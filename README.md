**SUMMARY OF FINDINGS**

-The number of accidents and casualties have decreased from the previous year to the current year which is a good thing because less   cases of accidents and casualties reported.

-Most of the accidents occurring results to slight injuries than fatal injuries which is a good thing because that means there are not a lot of deaths occurring as a result of road accidents.

-There are more accidents caused by cars, bikes and vans than bus and agricultural vehicles.

-Most accidents take place between September and November and less accidents occur between December and February and for other months the number of accidents and casualties are fairly balanced.

-There are more casualties taking place in single and dual carriageway so the road transport department has to focus more on these roads.

-There are less accidents and casualties happening in the rural areas compared to the urban areas. This is due to the busyness of the urban areas compared to the rural areas.

-Because most people drive during the day, most accidents take place then than during the night when it’s dark and there are less vehicles on the road.
